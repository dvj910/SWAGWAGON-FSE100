GRA-J GO®️ presents the SwagWagon®️ for Project SPYN. The SwagWagon is a car that demonstrates autonomous navigation within a maze and can pickup and dropoff a passenger and is disabled-friendly too. It includes a color sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, and a touch sensor. The SwagWagon was built using the Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit and was programmed entirely on Matlab. It employs the wall follower maze algorithm.

GRA-J GO®️ is the team in FSE 100 class, that created Swagwagon®️. This team included Laleet Jayakumar, Fabian Rayen, Ashton Grant, Kyle Acor and myself.
